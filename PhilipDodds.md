## Summary

20 years experience in the software industry, defining, architecting and building products for Financial Services and Fortune 500 companies. Wide range of experience in leveraging open source technologies, working with partners, onshore and offshore teams. 

The past few years I have been focused on big data, structured and unstructured sources and data management. With products ranging from high-performance streaming of data, NoSQL and Hadoop/HDFS architecture in environments using public/private clouds.

Recently working with companies focused on leveraging metadata, sampling, analytics and machine learning to start pushing the boundaries of data management. Helping large organizations start to understand how new technology can be deployed and how to work with hybrid data environments and service patterns.
